## OS detection

To get information about the current CloudLinux OS edition, you can run the following command:

    cldetect --detect-edition
    
A response for CloudLinux OS Solo will be like follows:

    CloudLinux OS Solo 

## Best practices for virtualization templates

While we recommend and support using of the usual [CloudLinux Solo](/installation/) installation process, 
it may require more time than is necessary for Virtual Private Server (VPS) and Virtual Machine (VM) hosts. 

Instead, you can provision VPS or VM systems with a templated environment.

### Create a minimal installation for templating

Before you begin, you need the activation key that you will use for CloudLinux OS Solo installation. 
Follow the [installation](/installation/) guide and create the minimal working CloudLinus OS Solo environment.
Use activation key to register your instance and get full access to repositories and run the
`yum update` command to fetch recent changes.

### Manage templates

#### Provisioning

We recommend using tools like `ansible` to add packages and tune server configuration.
You are free to install any control panels, tune settings and configure the default CloudLinux tools.

#### Finalize your template

If you install the control panel in your customized template, 
please run following commands once installation is done.

    /usr/bin/package_reinstaller.py
    
Commands above will fix hooks and control panel plugins after installation.

Before you save your customized template, it is required to remove license files:

    rm -f /etc/sysconfig/rhn/jwt.token*
    rm -f /etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid*
    rm -f /etc/sysconfig/rhn/cl-rollout*

#### Updating templates

:::tip
We strongly recommend recreating templates at least once a month to keep images
fresh and up-to-date with the recent CloudLinux OS Solo repositories.
:::

There are two ways of templates update:

1. Recreate them from scratch each time (recommended).
2. Boot customized template, register instance again and run the `yum update` command.
   Don't forget to remove license keys from the template as described 
   in [Finalize your template](./#finalize-your-template).

#### Next steps

Save the modified environment as the template and publish it for your clients.
